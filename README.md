# Getting Started on Ruby

Ruby is like Perl, Python & Smalltalk <br />
It is created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan in 1995 <br />

It is not a compiled language like C++, Java or Visual Basic <br />

It is an object-oriented language <br />

It is easily readable code <br />

You do not use semicolons in coding <br />

It has lots of "syntatic sugar" - shortcuts <br />

It is not just for the Web. <br />
It is a multipurpose language <br />

# Ruby on rails
Unlike Ruby, Ruby on rails is for web developments. <br />
Ruby on rails is a web framework written in Ruby. <br />
